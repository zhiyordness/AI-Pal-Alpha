AI-Pal Alpha is a chatbot powered by the **Groq API**. This chatbot will respond to user messages in real time using advanced AI models! Instead of a graphical interface, we’re keeping it sleek and **console-based**—just like real-world API integrations.

## **💡 Why This Project?**  
By the end of this project, you’ll:  
✅ Master **API integration** using Python.  
✅ Learn how to **handle errors gracefully** when making API requests.  
✅ Develop a **real-world chatbot** with **multi-turn conversation** capabilities.  
✅ Gain experience working with **AI-powered models** like `llama3-8b-8192`.  

No prior AI experience? No problem! This is your **hands-on introduction** to building with AI! 🚀

## **🛠️ Step 1: Get Your API Key**  
Before we start coding, you'll need access to the **Groq API**. Here’s how to get your key:  

1️⃣ Go to **[Groq’s official website](https://groq.com/)** and create an account.  
2️⃣ Navigate to your **dashboard** and generate an API key.  
3️⃣ Copy the key (keep it secret 🤫) and **paste it into the code** below.  

---

## **🖥️ Step 2: Build Your AI Chatbot**  

Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual **Groq API key**, then run this script:  

```python
import groq

# Initialize Groq API client
client = groq.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")  # Replace with your actual API key

# Function to get AI response from Groq API
def get_ai_response(user_input):
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="llama3-8b-8192",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content  # Corrected access
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"

# Main loop for user input
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Welcome to your AI chatbot! Type 'exit' to quit.")
    while True:
        user_input = input("\nYou: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
            print("\nGoodbye! 👋")
            break
        response = get_ai_response(user_input)
        print("AI:", response)
```

### **🛠️ Step 3: Run Your Chatbot!**  
- Open your **IDE or terminal**.  
- Run the script and start chatting with your **AI assistant!**  
- Type `"exit"` or `"quit"` to stop the conversation.
